    1. Can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_).
    2. Must start with a letter or an underscore (_), not a digit.
    3. Cannot use C++ keywords (e.g., int, float, return).
    4. Case-sensitive (var and Var are different).
    5. No special characters (except _).
    6. Should be meaningful for readability.
